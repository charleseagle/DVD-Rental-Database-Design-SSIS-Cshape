# DVD-Rental-Database-Design-SSIS-Cshape
The transcational database was desgined using SQL Server, SSIS, and C#. I used two triggers and one stored procedure to accomplished the goal. It servers for members. It can also record a new member. It can record every rental and return process. The only inputs for rental are scans of DVD and Member card. The only input for return is scan of DVD. It is a good practice.
